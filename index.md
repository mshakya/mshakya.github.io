# About
Hi, I’m Migun. My research interest lies in using genomics to address some of the most important and compelling questions related to biosecurity and the environment. I am currently developing an early warning framework using wastewater to detect both known and unknown biothreats, and I am interested in expanding this approach to other environmental sources such as aerosols and soils. In environmental microbiology, I am particularly interested in characterizing the many ways viruses interact with microbial communities and influence broader environmental processes, such as terrestrial elemental cycling. Lastly, I enjoy re-hacking bioinformatics workflows, even when it’s not strictly necessary.
